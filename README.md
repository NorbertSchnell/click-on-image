# click-on-image

This example allows for creating a graph of images with associated sounds. For each image a set of link points is defined that allow for advancing to a linked image.

When opening the page, the first image is displayed silently. The mouse cursor changes its appearance when hovering over a link point. Clicking on a link point will (dis)play the linked image and sound with a new set of link points.

When holding down the shift-key the link fields appear (in red).
